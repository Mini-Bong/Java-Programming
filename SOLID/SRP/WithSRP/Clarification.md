What is the problem with this design? This answer is that It violates the SRP here. You can see that displaying an employee detail, generating an employee id, or checking a seniority level are all different activities. Since I put everything in a single class, I may face problems adopting new changes in the future. Here are some possible reasons:

1. The top management can set a different criterion to decide a seniority level.

2. They can also use a complex algorithm to generate the employee id.

In each case, Iâ€™ll need to modify the Employee class. Now you understand that it is better to follow the SRP and separate these activities.
